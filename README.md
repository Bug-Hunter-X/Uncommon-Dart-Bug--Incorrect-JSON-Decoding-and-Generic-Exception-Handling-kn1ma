# Uncommon Dart Bug: Incorrect JSON Decoding and Generic Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Dart code that involves handling JSON responses from an API. The bug arises from making assumptions about the structure of the JSON data and using insufficient exception handling.

## Bug Description
The `fetchData` function fetches data from an API. The error occurs because it assumes the JSON response will always be a list of maps. If the server returns a different data structure (e.g., a single map, an error message), the `jsonDecode(response.body) as List<Map<String, dynamic>>` will throw a type error.  The `catch` block is also too generic, making it difficult to diagnose the exact problem. 

## Solution
The solution involves adding robust error checking and handling to account for various response scenarios, and using type checking to prevent runtime errors.
